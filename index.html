      <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
      <h5>Air pollution is a mixture of solid particles and gases in the air. Car emissions, chemicals from factories,
          dust, pollen and mold spores may be suspended as particles.</h5>
        <p id="causes-air">
       <h3>Causes of Air Pollution</h3>
            <h4 id="air">1. Burning of fossil fuels:</h4> 
                <p>
                   When fossil fuels are burned, large quantities of carbon dioxide are emitted into the air causing <br>
                   the heat to be trapped in atmoshpere, which causes climate change. For example, coal, petroleum, <br>
                   and other factory combustions is a major cause, which causes the air to be harmful, since so many <br>
                   bad chemicals and gases are thrown out. By doing this everyday, we are hurting ourselves and the <br>
                   earth. 
                </p>
         
            <h4 id="air">2. Exhaust from Factories and Industries</h4>
                <p>
                   Industries, especially manufacturing industries release huge amounts of carbon monoxide,<br>
                   hydrocarbons, organic compounds, and chemicals into the air, thus, depleting the quality of air.<br>
                   Manufacturing can be found in every corner of the world and there isn't a single place that is not<br>
                   affected by it. Factories also contribute in producing large amounts of harmful gases as they, too, <br>
                   burn large amounts of fossil fuels. 
                </p>
          
            <h4 id="air">3. Indoor Air Pollution</h4>
                <p>
                   Household items such as painting suppiles emit toxic chemicals into the air, which causes air <br>
                   pollution. Also, if you have carpets in your house, then the dust falls onto your carpet as <br>
                   the carpet collects it, making your house even more dusty, whithout you relazing it. World <br>
                   Health Organization (WHO) says that "The combined effects of ambient (outdoor) and household <br>
                   air pollution cause about seven million premature deaths every year... ." This shows us how <br>
                   dangerous air pollution can be and is.   
                </p>
         
            <h4 id="air">4. Agricultural Activties</h4>
                <p>
                   Ammonia is used in agricultural-related activties and is one of the most hazardous gases in the <br>
                   atmoshpere. Pesticides and fertilizers have grown a lot these days and emit harmful chemicals <br>
                   into the air and water causing air and water pollution. Farmers also set the crops and fields on <br>
                   fire to keep them clean, so they are ready to sow, again. When fields and crops are burned they <br>
                   release enormous amounts of harmful gases into the air.

   <div id="causes-of-noise-pollution" class="section">
    <div class="section">
     <h2>Noise Pollution</h2>
     <h5>Noise pollution is an invisible danger. It cannot be seen, but it is present nonetheless, both on land and under the sea. Noise pollution is considered to be any unwanted or disturbing sound that affects the health and well-being of humans and other organisms.</h5>
     <p id="causes-noise">
     <h3>Causes of Noise Pollution</h3>

         <h4 id="noise">1. Industrialization</h4>
            <p>
                Many industries use big machines which produce large amounts of noise. Plus, there are other <br>
                machines such as compressors, generators, exhaust fans, and grinding mills which also, participate <br>
                in producing loud noises. The workers in these industries have to wear earplugs to reduce the volume <br>
                of the noise, but still all the noise is not depleted. Even after such precautionaries the noise can <br> 
                hurt them and damage their ears a lot, especially after working for long periods of time.
            </p> 

         <h4 id="noise">2. Transportation</h4>
            <p>
                There are many vehicles on the road, in the air such as airplanes, helicopters, etc, and underground <br>
                trains which produce massive noise. People who live nearby these places slowly lose the full capicity <br>
                of hearing and can't hear small noises like others can. This becomes a difficulty for those who live <br>
                there. 
            </p>

         <h4 id="noise">3. Construction Activites</h4>
            <p> 
                When there are construction activties going on such as mining, construction of bulidings, dams, bridges, <br>
                roads, stations, etc plenty of noises are heard. These constructions take place everyday in some part of <br>
                the world, since we need to make the roads stronger after they have gotten old and need more bulidings <br>
                and bridges to accomodate more people. Meanwhile, this does help us to travel and live, but such noises <br>
                that are heard for a long period of time cause the ears harm. Noise like these are strong and hearing <br>
                almost veryday hinders the hearing abilities of individuals, especially the workers. 
            </p>

         <h4 id="noise">4. Noises form Air Traffic</h4>
            <p>
                Airjets and other flying vehicles create a lot of noise. The noise produced by a single aircraft is 130 dB. <br>
                If you have ever heard a jet takeoff right next to you, then you know how loud it is, and such loud noises <br>
                over 120 dB cause immediate damage to your ears. For instance, take numerous airjets and imagine all the <br>
                noise they produce in our air space. That's pretty loud, isn't it?

      <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
      <h5>Water pollution is any chemical, physical or biological change in the quality of water that has a harmful effect on any living thing that drinks or uses or lives (in) it. When humans drink polluted water it often has serious effects on their health. Water pollution can also make water unsuited for the desired use.</h5>
      <p id="causes-water">
      <h3>Causes of Water Pollution</h3>
        <h4 id="water">1.Industrial Waste</h4>
            <p>
              Industries produce an enormous amount of waste, for example, cafeteria garbage, dirt and gravel, masonry <br>
              concrete, scrap metals, trash, oil, solvents, chemicals, weed grass and trees, wood and scrap lumber, and <br>
              similar wastes. All of these wastes and chemicals are really harmful to the environment, animals, and us. <br>
              Industries, which do not have proper waste management system, drain the waste into the fresh water. This <br>
              waste, later on, goes into canals, rivers, and later into the sea. All of the bad waste and toxic chemicals <br>
              change the temperature of water, increase the number of minerals, called eutrophication, change the color of <br>
              water, and arise severe problems to the water organisms.  
            </p>

        <h4 id="water">2. Sewage and Wastewater</h4>
            <p>
               Sewage and wastewater are produced in each household that are chemically treated and then released into sea <br>
               along with fresh water. The sewage water carries harmful chemicals and bacterias which hurt the sea, cause <br>
               serious health problems and diseases, and hurt the sea animals. There are billions of people on earth, so we <br>
               need to pay close attention and treat sewage water since it's a big priority. There are many places where <br>
               some people don't have the access to clean water and sanitary conditions, which can cause them to have some <br>
               health problems or might even develop a disease. There are also microorgansims in the water that known to <br>
               cause deadly diseases. So if sewage water is left untreated, then the water can contaminate the environment <br>
               and cause diseases such as Malaria.
            </p>

        <h4 id="water">3.Marine Dumping</h4>
            <p>
              The garbage collected from our household such as paper, plastic, food, aluminum, rubber, glass, is collected <br>
              and then dumped into the ocean or sea in some countries. Items like these take 2 weeks or even 100 of years to <br>
              decompose, especially plastic which can take millions of years to decompose. When such garbage goes put into <br>
              the sea/ocean, water organisms are harmed. Safe Water Drinking Foundation states "Litter items such as 6-pack <br>
              ring packaging and microfilament fishing lines can entrap pelicans and other seabirds, and ultimately strangle <br>
              or starve the birds. For example, the world’s largest living turtle, the leatherback, ... . ...  mistake plastic <br>
              bags, balloons or containers for jellyfish — their favourite food." This shows us how animals of all kind are <br>
              being harmed and endangered. Just because of our garbage and trash other species of animals are getting hurt, <br>
              so we need to stop littering and focus on how we can stop this. 
            </p>

        <h4 id="water">4.Accidental Oil Leakage</h4>
            <p>
                Accidental oil leakage, especially large amounts of oil spills have a huge effect on the sea/ocean because oil <br>
                does not dissolve in water. When a ship is carrying large amounts of oil, it may spill if it meets with an <br>
                accident. Such accidents can cause varying damage to local marine life depending on the amount of spill, <br>
                toxins, and the size of the ocean because when this happens it suffocates fish, gets caught in the feathers <br>
                of marine birds stopping them from flying and blocks light from photosynthetic aquatic plants.

            <h4 id="air">1.Effects of Air Pollution</h4>
               <p>
                  The effects of air pollution are very problematic. Air pollution causes respiratory and heart problems, <br>
                  child health problems, global warming, acid rain, eutrophication, force wildlife species to move to a <br>
                  new place and change their habitat, and depletion of the ozone layer. We can solve these issues by using <br>
                  public mode of transportation, implant better household practices, conserve energy, get a clear <br>
                  understanding of reduce, reuse, and recycle, emphasis on clean resources, and use energy efficient <br>
                  devices. 
                </p>
            
            <h4 id="noise">2. Effects of Noise Pollution</h4>
                <p>
                The effects of noise pollution can give you hearing problems, psychological issues, physical problems, <br>
                cognitive issues & behavioral changes, sleeping disorders, cardiovascular issues, trouble communicating, <br>
                and animals can't communicate if there's constant noise. One way we could solve these issues is if the <br>
                government takes measures to ensure correct noise management. 
                </p>

            <h4 id="water">3. Effects of Water Pollution</h4>
                <p>
                   The effects of water pollution can also give you health problems and other problems such as contamination <br>
                   of the food chain, lack of potable water, diseases like cholera, hepatitis A, dysentery, etc, infant <br>
                   mortality, and death of aquatic animals. Solutions to solve water pollution are have wastewater <br>
                   treatment, increase green agriculture, have stormwater management, prevent air pollution as much as <br>
                   possible, reduce use of plastic waste, and conserve water.
